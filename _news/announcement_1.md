Our preprint [*Multilingual Blending: LLM Safety Alignment Evaluation with Language Mixtures*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07342) is available on arXiv. This paper introduces **Multilingual Blending**, a mixed-language query-response scheme
designed to evaluate the safety alignment of SOTA LLMs under sophisticated, code-switching conditions.
