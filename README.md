### Hello there!

I am currently a a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta. 
My primary research directions are oriented on **Quality Assurance** for **Trustworthy AI systems** such as **AI-enabled Cyber-Physical systems (AI-CPS)** and **Foundation Models**.

Two questions keep me up at night and encourage me to explore further, namely, **(1) How to safeguard the quality of sophisticated AI systems?** and **(2) What is the best practice of cyber-physical interaction?**
