## About Me

I am currently an **Assistant Professor** in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at [Macau University of Science and Technology](https://www.must.edu.mo/index.html?locale=en_US). 
I received my **Ph.D.** (Software Engineering and Intelligent System) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) in 2025, **M.Eng** at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2021, and **B.Eng** at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html) in 2019.
<!-- I am grateful for the support from the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/) and [Future Energy System (FES)](https://www.futureenergysystems.ca/). -->

## Research Interest

My primary research direction revolves around **Quality Assurance for Trustworthy AI systems** such as **AI-enabled Cyber-Physical systems (AI-CPS)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Multimodal AI Agents**.

<!-- Two questions keep me up at night and encourage me to explore further, namely, 
**(1) How to safeguard the quality of sophisticated AI Systems?** and 
**(2) What is the best practice of cyber-physical interaction?** -->

My research is devoted to exploring these directions in three stages: 
(1) **testing and evaluating** the performance and reliability of generative AI in dynamic, real-world environments, 
(2) **developing** methods to enhance the safety and resilience of complex AI systems, and 
(3) **investigating** the potential of multimodal foundation models to revolutionize the capabilities of AI applications.

My **long-term vision** is to create a cohesive research program that pushes the boundaries of AI
systems by combining foundational models and cutting-edge quality assurance techniques.
