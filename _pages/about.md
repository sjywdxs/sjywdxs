## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), supervised by [Prof.Lei Ma](https://www.malei.org/). I received my M.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Machine Learning from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2021, B.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Control and Communication from [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html) in 2019. I am grateful for the support from the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/) and [Future Energy System (FES)](https://www.futureenergysystems.ca/).

## Research Interest

My primary research directions are oriented on **Quality Assurance for Trustworthy AI systems** with concretion on **AI-enabled Cyber-Physical systems (AI-CPS)**.

AI-CPS are integrated systems in which traditional software units, Artificial Intelligence (AI) components, and physical plants are intertwined to collaboratively perform complex tasks (e.g., Robotics, Energy Systems, Autonomous Driving). However, two questions keep me up at night and encourage me to explore further, namely, 
**(1) How to safeguard the quality of sophisticated AI-CPS?** and 
**(2) What is the best practice of cyber-physical interaction?**

My research is devoted to investigating these two questions in three stages: (1) design AI-aware **testing and evaluation** techniques to reveal the capability of AI-CPSs, (2) propose novel **analysis** strategies to understand the behavior characteristics of AI components w.r.t. the physical world, and (3) develop **enhancement** solutions to improve the overall safety and reliability of the system across domains.
